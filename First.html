				<h2> What is UX Design? </h2>
				<p> UX (User experience) design is a human-first way of designing products. Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, is credited with coining the term “user experience” in the late 1990s. Here’s how he describes it:

                                   “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”

				   – Don Norman, Cognitive Scientist & User Experience Architect

				   Clear, right? Well you might note immediately that despite what I implied in the introduction, the definition has no reference to tech, no mention of digital, and doesn’t tell us all that much about what a UX designer actually does. But like all professions, it’s impossible to distill the process from just a few words.

				   Still, Don Norman’s definition tells us that, regardless of its medium plenty of non-digital UX (and there’s lots out there!) UX Design encompasses any and all interactions between a potential or active customer and a company.

 				   As a scientific process it could be applied to anything; street lamps, cars, Ikea shelving, and so on.

				<h2> What is UI Design? </h2>
				<p> Despite it being an older and more practiced field, the question “What is UI (user interface) design?” is difficult to answer because of its broad variety of misinterpretations.

				    While user experience is a conglomeration of tasks focused on the optimization of a product for effective and enjoyable use, user interface design is its complement; the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.

				    But like UX, it is easily and often confused by the industries that employ UI designers—to the extent that different job posts will often refer to the profession as completely different things.

				    If you look at job ads and job descriptions for user interface designers, you will mostly find interpretations of the profession that are akin to graphic design, sometimes extending also to branding design, and even frontend development.

				    If you look at “expert” definitions of User Interface Design, you will mostly find descriptions that are in part identical to User Experience Design—even referring to the same structural techniques. </p>
